# Content-Based-Image-Retrieval-System

The Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system addresses the growing need for efficient image retrieval within large digital collections. By allowing users to search for images based on visual content characteristics such as color and key point descriptors, this system provides a powerful tool for managing and utilizing vast image datasets. The project explores the architecture, functional components, and key techniques of CBIR systems, with a focus on the role of global and local features in image retrieval. Through a comprehensive evaluation on the GPR1200 dataset, the system's performance is analyzed using precision and response time metrics, offering valuable insights into the effectiveness and limitations of different CBIR approaches.

**Implementation Details**
- System Architecture: The CBIR system's architecture is designed to efficiently handle image feature extraction, indexing, and retrieval. It comprises modules for feature extraction using global and local descriptors, an indexing mechanism for fast retrieval, and a user interface for query input and result visualization.
- Techniques: Implementation focuses on integrating global features like color histograms and texture descriptors, alongside local features such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) keypoints and descriptors. These techniques enable the system to capture both holistic and detailed aspects of image content for accurate retrieval.
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision and response time are key metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of CBIR techniques. Precision measures the proportion of retrieved images that are relevant to the query, while response time assesses the system's speed in delivering results.
- Dataset: The GPR1200 dataset serves as the experimental foundation, providing a diverse set of images across various categories. Each technique is tested against this dataset to quantify its ability to retrieve relevant images accurately across different visual contexts and complexities.
